## Structure of coding lessons

All of the sessions are structured in the same way, presenting the following materials:

- _A narrated slideshow that demos the content we're working on_
- _The slideshow itself, which allows you to click links, copy code, etc._
- _A set of training exercises, marked as either 'Homework' or 'Classwork'_
- _Solutions to the training exercises, which will come online after class_
