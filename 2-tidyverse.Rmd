# c. 1: Exercises

## Homework

_Please complete the following exercises at home after going through the demo above. We will go through the solutions to these exercises in class on Wednesday Jan 31st_

Read in the coralreefherbivores.csv dataset (if you haven't already done so).

The “coralreefherbivores.csv” dataset contains trait information on 93 species of herbivorous coral reef fishes from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The first four columns provide taxonomic information (family, genus, species, and a combined genus + species column called “genspe”). The next column “sl” indicates the standard length of the fish. Then, you have three columns with morphological measurements of body depth, snout length, and eye diameter. Finally, you have two columns that indicate maximum body size (categories from XS to XL) and their schooling behavior. 

- a) Using the herbivore dataset, perform the following actions:
  - Determine the mean standard length and standard deviation for the families Acanthuridae, Labridae, and Siganidae. 
  - Create a variable that combines size and schooling into one column.
  - Count the number of species in each size class.
  - Calculate the ratio of snout length to standard length for each species, then determine which genus has the longest mean ratio of snout length to standard length.
  
### Bonus homework `r emo::ji('star_struck')`

_Perform these exercises if you want to treat yourself to some extra work. Note that this is not a required part of the homework assignment_

- learn about and apply the following functions:
  - <span style="color:orange"> *unite()* </span>
  - <span style="color:orange"> *separate()* </span>
  - <span style="color:orange"> *drop_na()* </span>
    
## Classwork

_We will do these exercises in class on Wednesday, January 31st_

The “fish_abundance.csv” dataset contains reef fish abundance information, which was collected by the Reef Life Survey around Lizard Island, Australia. It includes information on the respective survey ID and its metadata (e.g. site, latitude, longitude, date, and depth). It also includes a row for each observed species on a given visual survey, including taxonomic information (family, genus, species, and “genspe”), as well as the number of individuals observed on that survey (‘total’).

- a) Using the fish abundance dataset, perform the following actions:
  - In the family column, replace all occurrences of Scaridae with Labridae.
  - Filter the dataset to only retain the families Acanthuridae, Siganidae, Kyphosidae and Labridae.
  - Calculate the mean abundance of each genus using group_by() and summarize().
  - Remove the standard length, size, and schooling categories from the “coralreefherbivores.csv” dataset (from the previous exercise).
  - Calculate the mean body depth, snout length, and eye diameter of each genus using gather(), group_by(), and summarize().
  - Turn each trait into a column using spread().
  - Join the coralreefherbivores and fish_abundance datasets in their modified versions, retaining only genera that are present in the coralreefherbivores dataset and using “genus” as the joining variable.
  - using the joined trait and abundance dataset, apply the <span style="color:orange"> *case_when()* </span> function to:
  - create a new variable that separates genera into high (>=2.0) and low (<2.0) abundance genera
