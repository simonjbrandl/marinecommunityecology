## Lecture summary

This lecture shows the student's community drawings, provides an overview of how to quantify ecological communities, examines some large scale patterns in ecological communities, and details a few seminal theories. Specifically, it goes through various metrics we can use to describe communities (e.g., abundance, species richness, diversity indices), sheds light on global patterns of species richness in marine systems, and uses basic simulations to highlight various ecological theories over the course of the field's history.
