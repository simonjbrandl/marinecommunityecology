This is the companion page for **MNS352/MNS382: Marine Community Ecology**, taught at the University of Texas at Austin Marine Science Institute. The aim of this course is to provide students with a holistic understanding of the assembly and functioning of ecological communities in the marine environment. The course provides an introduction to using R for the analyses of ecological communities. All materials needed to follow and complete the coding lessons and exercises are provided on this page.
