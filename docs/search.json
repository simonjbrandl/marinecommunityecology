Students will learn about existing and emerging\n            theories and concepts in community ecology and gain insight\n            into traditional and modern techniques to study marine\n            communities, from visual censuses to molecular approaches.\n             The course includes quantitative training and practical\n            components using the software R, designed to foster an\n            understanding of basic statistical concepts in community\n            ecology and their thoughtful implementation. No existing\n            experience in R is required but familiarizing yourself with\n            the software early on may be helpful (see resources below).\n             The course includes two laboratory sessions to be held\n            on Sat/Sun in February (02/16-02/17) and April (04/27-04/28)\n            during which you will have an opportunity to engage in\n            hands-on research on marine and estuarine communities.\n            \n          \n          \n            \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n          \n            About this course\n          \n          \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            Course synopsis\n             This course aims to provide students with a holistic\n            understanding of the assembly and functioning of marine\n            communities.
