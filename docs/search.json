The first four columns provide taxonomic information (family, genus, species, and a combined genus + species column called ‚Äúgenspe‚Äù). The next column ‚Äúsl‚Äù indicates the standard length of the fish. Then, you have three columns with morphological measurements of body depth, snout length, and eye diameter. Finally, you have two columns that indicate maximum body size (categories from XS to XL) and their schooling behavior.\n\nPart I\nUsing the herbivore dataset, perform the following actions:\nDetermine the mean standard length and standard deviation for the families Acanthuridae, Labridae, and Siganidae.\nCreate a variable that combines size and schooling into one column.\nExamine the mean eye diameter of the genera Zebrasoma and Scarus.\nCount the number of species in each size class.\nCalculate the ratio of snout length to standard length for each species, then determine which genus has the longest mean ratio of snout length to standard length.\n\n\nlearn about and apply the following functions:\n unite() \n separate() \n distinct() \n drop_na() \n\n\n\nPart II\nThe ‚Äúfish_abundance.csv‚Äù dataset contains reef fish abundance information, which was collected by the Reef Life Survey around Lizard Island, Australia. It includes information on the respective survey ID and its metadata (e.g.¬†site, latitude, longitude, date, and depth). It also includes a row for each observed species on a given visual survey, including taxonomic information (family, genus, species, and ‚Äúgenspe‚Äù), as well as the number of individuals observed on that survey (‚Äòtotal‚Äô).\nUsing the fish abundance dataset, perform the following actions:\nReveal how many distinct surveys were performed aruond Lizard Island.\nIn the family column, replace all occurrences of Scaridae with Labridae.\nFilter the dataset to only retain the families Acanthuridae, Siganidae, Kyphosidae and Labridae.\nExamine how many different species are in each genus.\nCalculate the mean abundance of each genus across different sites using group_by() and summarize(), while also retaining a variable that indicates the number of species per genus.\n\n\nUsing the herbivore trait dataset, perform the following actions:\nDetermine whether the median eye diameter differs between species in different social groups.\nRemove the standard length, size, and schooling categories dataset.\nCalculate the mean body depth, snout length, and eye diameter of each genus.\nTurn each trait into a separate column.\n\n\nCombine the two datasets:\nJoin the coralreefherbivores and fish_abundance datasets in their modified versions, retaining only genera that are present in the coralreefherbivores dataset and using ‚Äúgenus‚Äù as the joining variable.\nCreate a new variable that separates genera into high (>=2.0) and low (<2.0) abundance genera\nExamine whether high and low abundance genera differ in their mean morphological traits\n\n\nd.¬†2: Solutions\nPart I\n\nUsing the herbivore dataset, perform the following actions:\nDetermine the mean standard length and standard deviation for the families Acanthuridae, Labridae, and Siganidae.\nCreate a variable that combines size and schooling into one column.\nExamine the mean eye diameter of the genera Zebrasoma and Scarus.\nCount the number of species in each size class.\nCalculate the ratio of snout length to standard length for each species, then determine which genus has the longest mean ratio of snout length to standard length.\n\n\n\n\nPart II\n\nUsing the fish abundance dataset, perform the following actions:\nReveal how many distinct surveys were performed around Lizard Island (SurveyID).\nIn the family column, replace all occurrences of Scaridae with Labridae.\nFilter the dataset to only retain the families Acanthuridae, Siganidae, Kyphosidae and Labridae.\nExamine how many different species are in each genus.\nCalculate the mean abundance of each genus using group_by() and summarize(), while also retaining a variable that indicates the number of species per genus.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the herbivore trait dataset, perform the following actions:\nDetermine whether the median eye diameter differs among different social groups.\nRemove the standard length, size, and schooling categories dataset.\nCalculate the mean body depth, snout length, and eye diameter of each genus.\nTurn each trait back into a separate column.\n\n\n\n\n\nCombine the two datasets:\nJoin the coralreefherbivores and fish_abundance datasets in their modified versions, retaining only genera that are present in the coralreefherbivores dataset and using ‚Äúgenus‚Äù as the joining variable.\nCreate a new variable that separates genera into high (>=2.0) and low (<2.0) abundance genera\nExamine whether high and low abundance genera differ in their mean morphological traits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The code for the model is below:\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nnum.sims <- 20 # specify the number of simulations \nnum.years <- 50 # specify the number of years\nfreq.1.mat <- matrix(ncol = num.sims, nrow = num.years) # create a matrix for output\n\n# FIRST LOOP FOR DIFFERENT SIMULATIONS\nfor (j in 1:num.sims) # use for-loop to run through the number of simulations\n  { \n  \n  J <- 100 # 100 individuals\n  t0.sp1 <- 0.5*J  # abundance of species 1 at time 0 \n  community <- vector(length = J) # set up community\n  community[1:t0.sp1] <- 1 # specify that half of the community is species 1\n  community[(t0.sp1+1):J] <- 2 # specify the other half is species 2\n  year <- 2 # set 'year' to 2 \n  freq.1.mat[1,j] <- sum(community==1)/J # fill community matrix\n  \n  # SECOND LOOP FOR INDIVIDUAL DEATH/BIRTH\n  for (i in 1:(J*(num.years-1))) # second for-loop to run multiple simulations\n    { \n    \n    freq.1 <- sum(community==1)/J # freq.1 represents the frequency of species 1\n    pr.1 <- freq.1 # pr.1 represents the frequency of reproduction\n    community[ceiling(J*runif(1))] <- sample(c(1,2), 1, prob=c(pr.1,1-pr.1))  # birth and death rates, based on probabilities\n    if (i %% J == 0)  # record data in the freq.1.mat matrix\n      { \n      \n      freq.1.mat[year, j] <- sum(community==1)/J\n      year <- year + 1\n      \n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nAfter that, wrangle the data as done in the lecture and produce the beautiful graph below.\n\n\ncolnames(freq.1.mat) <- 1:num.sims # set column names in matrix\n\nfreq.sp1.df <- as.data.frame(freq.1.mat) %>% # convert freq.1.mat into data frame \n  add_column(year = 1:num.years) %>% # add a column called year\n  gather(1:20, key = iteration, value = frequency) # gather into long format\n\np1 <- ggplot(freq.sp1.df, \n             aes(x = year, \n                 y = frequency, \n                 group = iteration)) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = frequency), \n            alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_color_gradient(low = \"darkorchid\",\n                       high = \"goldenrod\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,1)) +\n  xlab(\"Years\") +\n  ylab(\"Frequency of species 1\")\n\np1\n\n\n\nAccomplished? Well done. Here are your exercises:\nPart I:\nRun the same model but change the number of individuals to 500 and increase the number of years to 75\nRun the same model but decrease the number of individuals to 50, set the number of years back to 50, and increase the number of simulations to 50. Be careful with changing the number of simulations: you will have to adjust your downstream data wrangling code in the gather() function.\nChange the colors of your lines to be a beautiful green and blue instead and increase the opacity to 0.9.\n\nPart II\nIntroduce a selective advantage for Species 1 using a fitness ratio of 1.2. The fitness ratio affects the probability of reproduction in the following terms: fit.ratio * freq.1 / (fit.ratio * freq.1 + freq.2)\nRun a model with 300 individuals, 30 simulations, 50 years, and a fitness ratio of 1.2. Plot your outcomes (and make it pretty).\nRun the same model with 1000 individuals, 30 simulations, 50 years, and a fitness ratio of 1.2. Plot your outcomes next to your previous plot.\n\nPart III\nIntroduce negative frequency dependence into your model. To do so, you first need to define your average fitness ratio (fit.ratio.avg) based on the prevailing selective advantage. Frequency dependence then affects the fit.ratio in the following terms: exp(freq.dep * (freq.1 - 0.5) + log(fit.ratio.avg)).\nRun a model with 300 individuals, 30 simulations, 50 years, an average fitness ratio of 1.2, and a negative frequency dependence of -0.3. Plot your outcomes.\nRun a model with 1000 individuals, 30 simulations, 50 years, a fitness ratio of 1.5, and a negative frequency dependence of -0.5. Plot your outcomes.\n\nPart IV\nIntroduce positive frequency dependence and change your starting densities. To do so, follow the same steps as above but also adjust your initial populations.\nRun a model with 1000 individuals, 30 simulations, 50 years, a fitness ratio of 1.1, and a positive frequency dependence of 0.1, with a starting frequency of Species 1 at 0.3.\nRun a model with 1000 individuals, 30 simulations, 50 years, a fitness ratio of 1.0, a positive frequency dependence of 0.3, and a starting frequency of Species 1 at 0.75.\nd.¬†4: Solutions\nPart I:\nRun the same model but change the number of individuals to 500 and increase the number of years to 75\n\n\n\nRun the same model but decrease the number of individuals to 50, set the number of years back to 50, and increase the number of simulations to 50.

Students will learn about existing and emerging theories and concepts in community ecology and gain insight into traditional and modern techniques to study marine communities, from visual censuses to molecular approaches.\n\nCoding in R: The course includes quantitative training and practical components using the software R, designed to foster an understanding of basic statistical concepts in community ecology and their thoughtful implementation. No existing experience in R is required but familiarizing yourself with the software early on may be helpful (see resources below).\n\nFieldwork: The course also includes hands-on field surveys and collections, performed in coastal environments in South Texas. Some of them (bird surveys) can be replicated in almost any type of environment to obtain similar data.\nLearning objectives\nAll students:\nGain a thorough understanding of ecological theory\nAcquire/improve computational skills to explore, analyze, and visualize data in R\nExpress scientific knowledge in writing via research papers, syntheses, and short essays\nPresent your work and follow/contribute to discussions on marine community ecology\nSurvey, sample, process, and analyze marine and estuarine communities in the field\nLearn how to assess your own progress and growth in a non-traditional grading format\nGraduate students:\nGain advanced skills in R that allow you to troubleshoot coding issues and help your peers navigate the pitfalls of data wrangling, analyses, and visualization in R\nDevelop leadership skills in research, including the capacity to steer discussions, tackle problems, find solutions, and delegate tasks\nSynthesize research outcomes into a brief, compelling narrative, pitched to a journal using a cover letter, abstract, and figures\nAssignments\nAssignments differ depending on your enrollment (undergraduate vs.¬†graduate), as indicated below. For undergraduate students, assignments will include homework, self-evaluations, and three main projects, two of them written and one as a group presentation. For graduate students, there will be one additional presentation and a skeleton paper for journal ‚Äòsubmission‚Äô.\nProject 1: Paper critique\nFor the first project, you will compose a 3-page double-spaced critique of a prominent theory in community ecology. At least 10 relevant references should be included on a separate page. You will work in small groups to assemble and review literature on the theory, but each individual will compose their own essay. Theories and groups will be assigned during the second week of class. If you need more space, you are welcome to write up to (but no more) than 5 pages of double-spaced text. This is an individual paper, but you can work in groups to assemble, read, and classify literature.\nProject 2: Research paper\nFor the second project, you will compose a 5-page double-spaced research paper on the data collected during the first set of field surveys alongside some historical data. At least 15 relevant references should be included on a separate page. You will work together as a class to collect data, then each student will analyze, visualize, and interpret the data in a short research paper. Class time will be given for data analysis and visualization. Further project details will be presented in class.\nProject 3: Research presentation\nFor the third project, you will combine data collected during the second set of field surveys with some laboratory techniques. You will work as a group, crafting a short presentation (15 mins) that contain your main results and interpretations. Further project details will be presented in class.\n\n\n\n\n",
