Students will learn about existing and emerging\n            theories and concepts in community ecology and gain insight\n            into traditional and modern techniques to study marine\n            communities, from visual censuses to molecular approaches.\n             The course includes quantitative training and\n            practical components using the software R, designed to\n            foster an understanding of basic statistical concepts in\n            community ecology and their thoughtful implementation.
