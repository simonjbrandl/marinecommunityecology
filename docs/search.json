We will go through the solutions to these exercises in class on Wednesday Jan 31st\nRead in the coralreefherbivores.csv dataset (if you haven’t already done so).\n\nThe “coralreefherbivores.csv” dataset contains trait information on 93 species of herbivorous coral reef fishes from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The first four columns provide taxonomic information (family, genus, species, and a combined genus + species column called “genspe”). The next column “sl” indicates the standard length of the fish. Then, you have three columns with morphological measurements of body depth, snout length, and eye diameter. Finally, you have two columns that indicate maximum body size (categories from XS to XL) and their schooling behavior.\nUsing the herbivore dataset, perform the following actions:\nDetermine the mean standard length and standard deviation for the families Acanthuridae, Labridae, and Siganidae.\nCreate a variable that combines size and schooling into one column.\nCount the number of species in each size class.\nCalculate the ratio of snout length to standard length for each species, then determine which genus has the longest mean ratio of snout length to standard length.\n\nBonus homework 🤩\nPerform these exercises if you want to treat yourself to some extra work. Note that this is not a required part of the homework assignment\nlearn about and apply the following functions:\n unite() \n separate() \n drop_na() \n\nClasswork\nWe will do these exercises in class on Wednesday, January 31st\n\nThe “fish_abundance.csv” dataset contains reef fish abundance information, which was collected by the Reef Life Survey around Lizard Island, Australia. It includes information on the respective survey ID and its metadata (e.g. site, latitude, longitude, date, and depth). It also includes a row for each observed species on a given visual survey, including taxonomic information (family, genus, species, and “genspe”), as well as the number of individuals observed on that survey (‘total’).\nUsing the fish abundance dataset, perform the following actions:\nIn the family column, replace all occurrences of Scaridae with Labridae.\nFilter the dataset to only retain the families Acanthuridae, Siganidae, Kyphosidae and Labridae.\nCalculate the mean abundance of each genus using group_by() and summarize().\nRemove the standard length, size, and schooling categories from the “coralreefherbivores.csv” dataset (from the previous exercise).\nCalculate the mean body depth, snout length, and eye diameter of each genus using gather(), group_by(), and summarize().\nTurn each trait into a column using spread().\nJoin the coralreefherbivores and fish_abundance datasets in their modified versions, retaining only genera that are present in the coralreefherbivores dataset and using “genus” as the joining variable.\nusing the joined trait and abundance dataset, apply the  case_when()  function to:\ncreate a new variable that separates genera into high (>=2.0) and low (<2.0) abundance genera\n\nd. 1: Solutions\nThis section will provide the solutions for homework and classwork exercises.\n\n\n\n",

Students will learn about existing and emerging theories and concepts in community ecology and gain insight into traditional and modern techniques to study marine communities, from visual censuses to molecular approaches.\n\nThe course includes quantitative training and practical components using the software R, designed to foster an understanding of basic statistical concepts in community ecology and their thoughtful implementation. No existing experience in R is required but familiarizing yourself with the software early on may be helpful (see resources below).\n\nThe course includes two laboratory sessions to be held on Sat/Sun in February (02/16-02/17) and April (04/27-04/28) during which you will have an opportunity to engage in hands-on research on marine and estuarine communities.\n\n\n\n\n",
